## üß† About This Repository  

This repository contains the code I wrote for my **CS 333: Programming 
Languages** course.  
Throughout the semester, I explored how different programming languages 
are designed and implemented, and how their syntax, semantics, and 
paradigms shape the way we write code.  

The course introduced a variety of language families ‚Äî **imperative, 
object-oriented, functional, and logic paradigms** ‚Äî and emphasized 
understanding the underlying mechanisms that make each language work.  

I completed small exercises in multiple languages and two large projects 
of my choice. These projects challenged me to think about language 
structure, parsing, memory management, and abstraction at a deeper level.

## üß© Projects Overview  

### [Project 1 ‚Äì Language Foundations in C](project1/)
In this project, I focused on **C programming** and language structure at 
a low level.  
I implemented several small tasks and language extensions that helped me 
understand **how memory, functions, and modularity** work under the hood.  

This project includes:  
- Core tasks (`TaskOne.c` ‚Äì `TaskFive.c`)  
- Four language extensions (`extensionOne.c` ‚Äì `extensionFour.c`)  
- Screenshots showing program output and structure  
- A detailed project README with explanations and results

### [Project 2 ‚Äì Lexical Analyzer and Language Extensions](project2/)
This project was a deep dive into **language parsing, lexical analysis, 
and syntax design**.  
I used **Flex/Yacc** to build a custom lexical analyzer and added several 
language extensions across **C, JavaScript, and MySQL**.  
I also compared the behavior of built-in vs. custom binary search 
implementations as part of my language exploration.  

This project includes:  
- JavaScript and MySQL directories  
- Lexical analyzer tasks (`task1`‚Äì`task4`)  
- Multiple extensions implemented in C  
- Screenshots and detailed write-ups of the results

## üí≠ Reflection  

Working on these projects taught me how programming languages are **more 
than just tools** ‚Äî they‚Äôre designed systems with their own philosophies.  
By writing analyzers, creating syntax rules, and comparing languages, I 
developed a stronger appreciation for **language design, abstraction, and 
compiler behavior**.
